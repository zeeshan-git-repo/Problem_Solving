1. If question belongs to Array or Linked List
2. If sorted given or by sorting problem can be easy.
3. If asked to Merge/ Remove duplicate/ Rearrange
4. Detect Cycle written or making cycle problem can be solved
5. Tree, Graph, Stack, DP will not use Two Pointer
6. If asked in question to find pair/ triplet/ quadruple.

Agar number btana hai to sorting kr sakte hain and two sum apply hoga, leking agar index batana hai to nahi kar sakte.
